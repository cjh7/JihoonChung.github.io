My name is Jihoon Chung who is a Ph.D. candidate, under the supervision of Dr. Zhenyu (James) Kong in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech. During my Ph.D. study, the research I accomplished contributed to both quality assurance in the advanced manufacturing process, and methodological novelties.  I am currently in the job market and looking for an academic job.
