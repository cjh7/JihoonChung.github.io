My name is Jihoon Chung. I received Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Zhenyu (James) Kong in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech (May 2023). During my Ph.D. study, the research I accomplished contributed to both quality assurance in the advanced manufacturing process, and methodological novelties.  I will join National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a postdoctoral position.
