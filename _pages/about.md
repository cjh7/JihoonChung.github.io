I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering at Pusan National University in Korea. I received a Ph.D. in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) (May 2023). I also obtained M.S. and B.S. degrees in Industrial Engineering at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Hanyang University, respectively. 

My research area is developing data-driven methods, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistical learning, to achieve quality assurance in advanced manufacturing processes and solve various problems in healthcare systems and material analysis.
