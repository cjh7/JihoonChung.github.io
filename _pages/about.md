My name is Jihoon Chung.  I received Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Dr. Zhenyu (James) Kong in the Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech (May 2023) and am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the same lab. During my Ph.D. study, the research I accomplished contributed to both quality assurance in the advanced manufacturing process, and methodological novelties.
